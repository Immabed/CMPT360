# CMPT360
This repository is a collection of homework/lab assignments from the course CMPT 360 - Comparative Programming Languages, which I took in Spring 2017. Each directory in the main directory is one of the projects, and includes project documentation and source code in one or two programming languages.

The goal of the course was to gain an understanding of the basic programming constructs, what sorts of implementations are used in different languages, and what differences exist between different programming languages and language families.

The projects included in this directory showcase programs written in eight programming languages. When two languages are used, the project has been implemented independently in both languages.

* Complex Triangles -- C# and Fortran -- Calculate side lengths and angles of triangles in the complex plane.
* Quicksort -- Python and Fortran -- Floating point quicksort algorithm
* Stack and RPN Calculator -- Ruby -- Implements a stack data type, and uses it to create an interactive command line calculator with reverse polish notation (RPN)
* Benchmark with Sieve of Eratosthenes -- C++ and Ada -- Implements a version of the prime number algorithm, Sieve of Eratosthenes, and uses the resulting programs to compare two compilers for different languages based on runtime.
* Minesweeper -- Delphi -- A single player minesweeper game with GUI
* Substring Finding Algorithm -- Objective C -- Implements the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for finding substrings.

For the purposes of the course, I was required to choose each project from a selection of problems, and implement it in (usually) any language I chose. Over the entire course I was required to develop on three different platforms (I used Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux), and to usea certain number of languages from each of four different categories given by the professor. These requirements are mentioned at the beginning of each project's documentation.

The documentation was also a part of the project requirements.
